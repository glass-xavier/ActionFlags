# Action Flags!

Action Flags! is a keyframe logging application created with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and the [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/) toolkit.

## How to:
Once the application is launched, click the "Start Flagging" button to start recording timestamps. Every time the spacebar is pressed, a "flag" (timestamp) is created in a `hh:mm:ss.ms` format, relative to the start time recorded.
When the "Stop Flagging" button has been clicked, a final flag is recorded and the user is prompted to save a file. The filename is populated with the current date, and saved as a `.txt` file.

## Potential use cases:
Flagging moments during a video recording that need to be reviewed during editing.

This application is open source under the [MIT Licence](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) and available to fork or assist with development.
